    "# Probability with Python  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Based on *Probability and Conditional Expectation* by Styer and Nagel\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reducing Probability to Set Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1933, Andrey Kolmogorov showed that our usual intutions regarding proability can be captured formally using standard set-theoretic ideas. In particular, Kolmogorov showed that: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. A probability measure is a special case of a finite measure.\n",
    "2. A random variable is a special case of a measurable mapping.\n",
    "3. The expectation of a random variable is the integral of measurable mapping with respect to a probability measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Measure Theory Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "To appreciate these ideas, we must take a detour through *measure theory*. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can motivate the notion of a measure by thinking about an area function for the plane, and the properties we would like such a function to satisfy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that given a Cartesian coordinate system, we can associate each point of the plane with an ordered pair of the form (*a*, *b*), where *a* and *b* are real numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now suppose we wish to measure the area of a shape such as a rectangle in the plane. We can formalize this by defining an *area* function. The *area* function takes a *set* of ordered pairs as input and returns a non-negative real number as output, which represents the area of the measured region. The domain of the area function is a *set of sets*, since each each input into the area function is a different set of ordered pairs. Given a set *S*, a set of subsets from *S* is called a *set system*. Note that the largest set system on any set S is the Cartesian product *S* x *S* of the set *S* with itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "To agree with our intuitions of how an area function should behave, such an area function must satisfy the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The domain of an area function is a set system.\n",
    "2. If area is defined for two subsets A and B, then area is also defined for the union and intersection of A and B.\n",
    "3. If sets A and B are disjoint, then the area of their union is equal to the sum of their areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can generalize from the notion of an area function to the notion of a *measure* by simply replacing the word \"area\" with the word \"measure\" in our above list of conditions. Doing so, we obtain that a *measure* function must satisfy the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The domain of a measure is a set system.\n",
    "2. If a measure is defined for two subsets A and B, then the measure is also defined for the union and intersection of A and B.\n",
    "3. If sets A and B are disjoint, then the measure of their union is equal to the sum of their measures. This property is called *countably additivity*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of making such a generalization is that there exist other functions besides area functions that satisfy the above properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, it would seem a simple matter to define a measure on a set *S*: simply define the domain of the measure to be the Cartesian product of *S* x *S* - the set of all possible subsets of *S*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, things turn out to be more complex in the case that we are dealing with the set of all real numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, a set called a *Vitali set* can be defined such that if all of the following conditions are satisfied simultaneously for a given measure $\\mu$:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. μ is a (countably additive) measure.\n",
    "2. μ is translation invariant.\n",
    "3. μ( [0,1] ) $\\lt \\infty$.\n",
    "4. μ measures a Vitali set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, μ must assign a value of 0 to every set.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, we must be more careful in our choice of set system whcih we use as the domain of a measure μ. The key to avoiding such problems is a *sigma algebra*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: is *S* finite or countable, we can always use the powerset of *S* as a sigma-algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sigma Algebra\n",
    "\n",
    "A set 𝒜 of subsets of a nonempty set S is called a σ-algebra if:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The set S is a member of 𝒜.\n",
    "2. If a set A is a member of 𝒜, then the complement of A is also a member of 𝒜.\n",
    "3. If *n* sets $A_1,...,A_n$ are members of 𝒜, then their union is also a member of 𝒜.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each element of a sigma-algebra is called a *measurable set*. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ordered pair (*S*, 𝒜) is called a *measurable space*.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we begin with the set:\n",
    "\n",
    "$S = \\{0, 1\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then define the following sigma-algebra on $S$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$𝒜 = \\{S, \\{\\}, \\{0\\}, \\{1\\}\\} =  \\{\\{0, 1\\}, \\{\\}, \\{0\\}, \\{1\\}\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "By inspection, we can see that our above set $𝒜$ is a sigma algebra: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The entire sample space $S$ is a member of $𝒜$.\n",
    "2. $S \\in 𝒜$, and $S^c = \\{\\} \\in 𝒜$, $\\{0\\} \\in 𝒜$, and $\\{1\\}^c = \\{0\\} \\in 𝒜$.\n",
    "3. $\\{0\\} \\in 𝒜$ and $\\{1\\}$ and $\\{0\\} \\cup \\{1\\} = \\{0, 1\\} \\in 𝒜,$ etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Measure\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have a measurable space (*S*, 𝒜), we can define a function called a *measure* $\\mu$ that maps each element of 𝒜 into $[0, \\infty].$\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mu: 𝒜 \\rightarrow\\ [0, \\infty]$\n",
    "\n",
    "A measure is an example of a *set function* because it takes a set as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "A measure $\\mu$ must satisfy the following conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The measure of the empty set is 0.\n",
    "2. The measure of any set in 𝒜 is greater than or equal to 0.\n",
    "3. The measure of a countable union of disjoint sets equals the sum of the measure of each set in the union.\n",
    "\n",
    "If (*S*, 𝒜) is a measurable space and $\\mu$ is a measure on that space, we call the ordered triple (*S*, 𝒜, $\\mu$) a *measurable-space*.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if:\n",
    "\n",
    "$S = \\{0, 1\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "and\n",
    "\n",
    "$𝒜 = \\{S, \\{\\}, \\{0\\}, \\{1\\}\\} = \\{\\{0, 1\\}, \\{\\}, \\{0\\}, \\{1\\}\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "and our measure space is (*S*, 𝒜), then we can define the following measure:\n",
    "\n",
    "$μ(S) = 50$,\n",
    "$μ(\\{\\}) = 0$,\n",
    "$μ(\\{0\\}) = 25$,\n",
    "$μ(\\{1\\}) = 25$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can verify that μ is a measure as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $μ(\\{\\}) = 0$\n",
    "2. $μ(\\{S\\}) = 50 \\ge 0$, $μ(\\{\\}) = 0 \\ge 0$, $μ(\\{0\\}) = 25 \\ge 0$, $μ(\\{1\\}) = 25 \\ge 0$\n",
    "3. $μ(\\{0\\} \\cup \\{1\\}) = μ(\\{0, 1\\}) = 50 = 25 + 25 = μ(\\{0\\} + μ(\\{1\\})$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Measurable Mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a measurable space (*S*, 𝒜), it is often convenient to transform to a different measurable space which captures some information of interest more directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the measurable space (*S*, 𝒜) where:\n",
    "\n",
    "$S = \\{(h, h), (h, t), (t, h), (t, t)\\}$ and \n",
    "𝒜 is the powerset of S.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are only interested in the number of times *h* appears in each ordered pair, then we can define a function $X$ that maps elements of the set *S* into the set {0, 1, 2}. \n",
    "\n",
    "That is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$X: S \\rightarrow\\ \\{0, 1, 2\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$X[(t, t)] = 0, X[(t, h)] = 1, X[(h, t)] = 1,$ and $X[(h, h)] = 2.$\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have defined the function $X$, we can consider the *images* of various elements of 𝒜 when acted on by $X$. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$X(\\{(h, h), (h, t)\\}) = \\{1, 2\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$X(\\{(t, t), (h, t)\\}) = \\{0, 1\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$X(\\{(t, t), (t, h)\\}) = \\{0, 1\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$X(\\{(t, t), (h, h)\\}) = \\{0, 2\\}$, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the above image sets are all elements of the powerset of {0, 1, 2}. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the powerset of {0, 1, 2}, we can also compute inverse-images.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$X^{−1}(\\{0\\}) = \\{(t, t)\\},$ \n",
    "\n",
    "$X^{−1}(\\{1\\}) = \\{(h, t), (t, h)\\},$ \n",
    "\n",
    "$X^{−1}(\\{2\\}) = \\{(h, h)\\},$ \n",
    "\n",
    "$X^{−1}(\\{0, 1\\}) = \\{(t, t)\\},$ \n",
    "\n",
    "$X^{−1}(\\{0, 2\\}) = \\{(t, t)\\},$ and\n",
    "\n",
    "$X^{−1}(\\{01, 2\\}) = \\{(h, t), (t, h), (h, h)\\}.$ \n",
    "\n",
    "If we let $S' = \\{0, 1, 2\\}$ and 𝒜' = the powerset of S, then we can see that the function $X$ allows us to translate from the measurable space (S, 𝒜) to the measurable space (S', 𝒜') without losing the ability to assign a measure to elements of 𝒜'. \n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, we define a *measurable function* as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let (S, 𝒜), (S′, 𝒜′) be measurable spaces, and let X : S → S′ be a mapping. \n",
    "Then, f is called (𝒜, 𝒜′)-measurable if the preimage of any element of 𝒜′ is an element of 𝒜,\n",
    "That is, $f^{−1}(A′) ∈ 𝒜, ∀A′∈ 𝒜′.$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the definition of a measurable function does not explicitly refer to a measure μ, the reason for the name *measurable function* migth be unclear. The reason for this name is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Because a measure 𝜇 assigns a value to all elements A ∈ 𝒜, the measure 𝜇 also assigns a value to each $f^{−1}(A′) = \\{s ∈ S: f (s) ∈ A′\\}$. If 𝜇 is a measure on 𝒜 and f is (𝒜, 𝒜′)-measurable, then there is a value $𝜇[ f^{−1}(A′)]$ for all inverse images $f^{−1}(A′), A′∈ 𝒜′.$\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that every measure function from one measure space to another induces a function called an *image measure* on the new space. More formally:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let f : (Ω, 𝒜, 𝜇) → (Ω′, 𝒜′) be a measurable mapping. Then the function \n",
    "\n",
    "$𝜇_f : 𝒜′→ R$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$𝜇_f (A′) = 𝜇[f^{ −1}(A′)], ∀ A′∈ 𝒜′$\n",
    "is a measure on the measurable space (Ω′, 𝒜′).\n",
    "\n",
    "When we come to probability theory, we will see that the *distribution of a random variable* is just the image measure induced by that random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Probability Measure\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that a probability function is a special case of the more general notion of a measure. In particular, the only difference between a general measure and a probability measure is that a probability measure must assign the value of 1 to the entire set *S*. As a result, we call a probability function a *probability measure*. \n",
    "\n",
    "If (*S*, 𝒜) is a measurable space, then a probability measure on (*S*, 𝒜) must satisfy the following conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The measure of the set *S* is 1.\n",
    "2. The measure of any set in 𝒜 is greater than or equal to 0.\n",
    "3. The measure of a countable union of disjoint sets equals the sum of the measure of each set in the union.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first condition says that the probability of something happening is always 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second condition says that if we know the probability of some event, we always konw the probability of that event *not* happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third condition says that if we know the probability of one event happening and we know the probability of a second event happening, then we also know the probability of either event happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "If *p* is a probability measure on (*S*, 𝒜), then the ordered triple (*S*, 𝒜, *p*) is called a *probability space*. The value *p*(A) is called the *probability of A*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of probability, we call the set *S* the *sample space*, the elements of *S* *outcomes*, and the elements of 𝒜 *events*. Measurable functions $X$ from one probability space to another are called *random variables*.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can implement the above ideas in Python as follows for an experiment in which we flip a coin twice and count the number of heads that occured (we will not stick to sets exclusively since nesting sets in Python is tedious):"
